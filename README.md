## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✔] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [✔] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [✔] Remember the previously selected tip percentage across app restart.
- [✔] User can choose between light and dark mode.
- [✔] Settings page for selecting options.
- [ ] Add predefined categories (e.g. restaurants, food delivery, etc.) and set recommended tip percentage automatically.
- [ ] Add a "help" section where recommended tip percentages/amounts for different services are listed for the user to see.
- [ ] Add accent colors to complement the light and dark mode.
- [ ] Add a slider so make it easy for the user to select different percentages.

## Notes

I am an experienced Android developer and it was my first attempt at iOS development.
The initial challenge I faced was regarding how things work differently on both the 
platforms; both functionality and philosophy.
